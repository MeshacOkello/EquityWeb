                <p class="lead">Express your unique story and aspirations through a compelling personal statement.</p>
                <hr class="my-4">
                <p>A few hundred words to capture who you’ve become over the course of almost two decades? Yup, makes sense why lots of students find the idea of writing a personal statement intimidating. Framed like the above, it could almost sound, I don’t know, unreasonable.</p>
                    
                   <p> Whether you’re using the Common Application, the Coalition Application, or a school-specific application portal, it can be scary to try to come up with an essay topic that encompasses the complexity and vastness of who you are as a person … while also staying in the word count. </p>
                    
                   <p> But this can also be a fun, meaningful experience (real talk: We wouldn’t be doing this if we didn’t think it was true). In fact, the process of brainstorming and writing about meaningful aspects of your life can be an incredible way to practice self-reflection and think more deeply about who you are, what you value, who you hope to be in the world, and what you actually want to get out of college. 
                    
                    So to help you move past the intimidating aspects and focus more on the fun and meaning, in this post, we’ll describe what differentiates the personal statement from other college essays and what function it serves in your college application. We’ll also share what qualities can help a personal statement stand out, how to find a stronger topic, how to set yourself up for an easier writing process, and even share some essay examples that worked for previous applicants.</p><br>

                <h3 class="display-4">WHAT IS A PERSONAL STATEMENT? THAT JUST MEANS “ESSAY” … RIGHT?</h3><br>
                <p>A personal statement is an essay in which you demonstrate aspects of who you are by sharing some of the qualities, skills, and values you’ll bring to college. A written personal statement is typically used by college admission offices, but it’s also often used by scholarship selection committees or specific academic departments to help assess potential candidates.  </p><br>
                <p>In college applications, it is a critical component that offers insight into an applicant’s personality and values beyond academic achievements.</p><br>
                <p>There’s no “right” essay topic to write about, as you’ll see from the range of essay topics in this post. Students have written successfully on topics ranging from: I Shot My Brother, to Home, to Being Pooped on by Animals. Oh, and btw, we’d recommend not reading too many sample essays before you’ve done some brainstorming of your own first. </p><br>

                <h3 class="display-4">WHAT MAKES A GREAT PERSONAL STATEMENT?</h3>
                <p>Ultimately, there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to writing your personal statement that will magically make colleges admit you. <br> Bummer, we know. That said, the best personal statements often share a lot of the same qualities, even when they’re about drastically different topics.
                </p><br>
                    <p>An outstanding personal statement is characterized by several key qualities:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Identification of Core Values: It allows readers to identify the applicant's fundamental values, such as humor, beauty, community, and autonomy. The presence of varied values adds depth and nuance to the portrayal of the applicant.</li>
                            <li> Vulnerability: The best personal statements reveal a sense of vulnerability, where the writer opens up about fears, challenges, or concerns. This emotional honesty fosters a stronger connection between the reader and the applicant.</li>
                            <li>Insight and Growth: The statement should showcase moments of insight and personal growth, with at least 3-5 instances where the writer reflects on experiences and draws meaningful conclusions. These moments contribute to a deeper understanding of the applicant's values and sense of purpose.</li>
                            <li>Craftsmanship: Craftsmanship is essential for bringing the narrative to life. The writing should be articulate, carefully considered, and go through multiple drafts. Logical connections between ideas, evidence of thoughtful revisions, and maintaining reader interest are crucial aspects of a well-crafted personal statement.</li><br>Considering these qualities ensures that the personal statement not only communicates the writer's intellect but also emanates from a place of emotional vulnerability. Seeking feedback from trusted individuals can provide valuable perspectives and help refine the essay. 
                        </ol>

                <ol>
                    <li>Reflect on Personal Experiences: Consider which experiences or stories you are most eager to share.</li>
                    <li>Align with Your Strengths: Choose a prompt that showcases your strengths, talents, or unique perspectives.</li>

                    <li>Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.</li>
                    <li>The lessons we take from obstacles we encounter can be fundamental to later success. Recount a time when you faced a challenge, setback, or failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?</li>
                    <li>Reflect on a time when you questioned or challenged a belief or idea. What prompted your thinking? What was the outcome?</li>
                    <li>Reflect on something that someone has done for you that has made you happy or thankful in a surprising way. How has this gratitude affected or motivated you?</li>
                    <li>Discuss an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others.</li>
                    <li>Describe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose all track of time. Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to when you want to learn more?</li>
                    <li>Share an essay on any topic of your choice. It can be one you've already written, one that responds to a different prompt, or one of your own design.</li>

                <p>Dear Diary,<br></p>
                <p><u>13th March 2022</u></p>
                <p>“ She didn’t even give me room to explain my point of view. She simply said, <i>it’s unrealistic, “</i></p>
                <p>The drives back home were always me reprimanding my brother for his tardiness. Not this time. Having persevered through an incredibly arduous school term, he was the listening ear I needed.</p>
                <p>“What was your idea,” he asked.</p>
                <p>“ I wanted to expound on the utilization of digital transformation to unlock astute methods of
                    doing business,” I explained, referring to a class project. Unfortunately, my group leader deemed
                    my idea terrible.</p>
                <p>“ You’re the most brilliant person I know, it even scares me. Don’t let anyone take that away from
                    you,” he responded, absorbing my teenage grievances.</p>
                <p><i>I’m brilliant, my elder brother said so.</i></p>
                <p><u>1st April 2022</u></p>
                <p>Darren holds exceptional proficiency in Forex trading and he’s been training me for a while. I trade
                    his personal funds, a show of his trust in me and my fluency in the language of market analysis.</p>
                <p>My progress is genuinely impressive because diary, you better than anyone else, know my passion
                    for becoming an economic aficionado and try to address Kenya’s ongoing economic woes.</p>
                <p><i>With a brother like mine, the dream is within reach.</i></p>
                <p><u>21st July 2022</u></p>
                <p>Today, I was summoned to the principal’s office mid lesson. Seeing my uncle in the office, my
                    anticipation grew unaware of the devastating news that was in the offing. When the chaplain began to speak, the world around me seemed to fade in a blur as I struggled to comprehend the
                    weight of the loss I had just been informed of. Every fiber of my being felt indescribable pain as if a
                    part of me had been ripped off. As tears rolled down my face, I felt grief engulf me in its
                    suffocating embrace and I knew my life would forever take a different route.</p>
                <p><i>Darren died. I can’t talk about it.</i></p>
                <p><u>23rd September 2023</u></p>
                <p>Trying to move forward with a bleeding heart can be daunting. For the past two months, I’ve
                    devoted hours in the computer lab reading business articles, market trends and guess what, all my
                    predictions have been wrong! If only I had been actively trading, I would have lost about Ksh
                    17,000 if I had sold EUR/USD at 1.713 for 30 pips this week.</p>
                <p>I desire to break free from this cocoon. I yearn to soar, I really do, but it seems my wings are
                    drenched.</p>
                <p><i>I’m miserable.</i></p>
                <p><u>28th November 2022</u></p>
                <p>Darren’s mantra, “ Life’s tough, get a helmet,” has been my guiding light. No amount of tears can
                    bring him back, unfortunately. I had a choice– drown in grief or get a helmet and face the world
                    head-on. I chose the latter.</p>
                <p>Understanding that my dreams and Darren’s hinged on my success, passing my national exams
                    became my main focus. The desire to prove my resilience, propelled my newfound determination.
                    This time, my excuse for not journaling daily isn’t my misery, rather, my busy schedule. I’ve been
                    immersed in practicing past papers, consultations, engaging in peer discussions - basically,
                    everything required to excel academically. The highlight of my days is attending the Zumba
                    classes every evening.</p>
                <p><i>I’m healing. Darren would want that for me.</i></p>
                <p><u>5th January 2023</u></p>
                <p>In this journey, I took a decisive step forward and embarked on a transformative path: to gain
                    financial literacy. To honor Darren’s dreams and prevent them from fading into oblivion, I
                    embraced the torch he left behind: running his snack bar and play station shop. The proceeds from
                    these plus contributions from family and friends have culminated in the establishment of a
                    foundation in Darren’s name.</p>
                <p>From this tragedy, I have discovered an unwavering wellspring of personal growth and
                    development. Each hurdle I overcome, every milestone I achieve, serves as a testament to the
                    indomitable spirit within me.</p>
                <p><i>And dear diary, I will keep you updated on this new journey.</i></p><br><br>

                <p>Walking along the bustling high school hallways.</p>
                <p>Murmurs.</p>
                <p>Student 1: He's topped the mock exam for the third time.</p>
                <p>Student 2: He is winner of last weekend’s Math Olympiad.</p>
                <p>Student 3: He helped me learn calculus.</p>
                <p>Student 3: He will certainly emerge best in the final high school national examination.</p>
                <p>Student 4, 5, 6…more, with amazing words about me.</p>
                <p>Am I happy? My smile dazzles like a radiant sun. No, I am feigning it, again! If only I could shed this
                    mask, this part of me that I have to hide, I know, all their views about me would change drastically.
                    For now, they like me, and they do not care about my sexual orientation. I like my impact and roles
                    towards my fellow students, but I would not like what they would do to me if I said I am gay-so I
                    choose not to come out, yet.</p>
                <p>In grade seven, I was enchanted by the sheer allure of Robin, a classmate. His angelic face, with a
                    mischievous twinkle in his deep emerald eyes, could melt the coldest hearts. His perfectly
                    sculpted features were an exquisite work of art. Discovering my attraction to him was a revelation
                    that propelled me into uncharted territory, where I navigated the delicate balance between selfdiscovery
                    and societal expectations. The burden of secrecy and the constant fear of discovery
                    suffocated my true self. The prevailing view around me dismissed gays as misfits, rendering
                    coming out untenable.</p>
                <p>I have witnessed firsthand harsh judgments accompany individuals like me. In high school, I
                    witnessed suspected gays brutally attacked. The school administration’s failure to protect us
                    frustrated me further; my sexuality would lead to an expulsion from school. Despite the accolades
                    I earned, I longed for an embracive and supportive environment, recognizing that with such, my
                    potential for excellence would have thrived. Changing schools briefly crossed my mind, the next
                    second I recalled my father’s harsh, stern words, when there was news about a university student
                    murdered following allegations that he was gay; “My children”, his voice thundered with ironclad resolve, “If any of you dare to embrace queerness, know this: I shall disown you without
                    hesitation.” Devoid of refuge, I stayed silent about my true identity.</p>
                <p>Injustice expands beyond school walls. Kenya has witnessed relentless oppression against the
                    LGBTQ community, the criminals escaping unscathed. Homosexuality remains criminalized under
                    Section 162 of the penal code; for merely being true to ourselves, we risk facing 14 years in prison.
                    Is this not fundamentally unfair? I did not choose to be gay, my sexual orientation is an inherent
                    part of me, just as my race is. Shouldn’t we fight for the rights of the LGBTQ community in Kenya,
                    with the same vigor we employ to combat tribalism? My dreams envision a diverse and embracing
                    nation. It is for this reason that The National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission inspires
                    me, with their untiring dedication to defending and promoting our rights through legal support,
                    advocacy, and impactful campaigns. Each day strengthens my courage for self-discovery,
                    anticipating a future where I can proudly be celebrated for my authentic self.</p>
                <p>Regardless of sexual orientation, I firmly believe in unwavering acceptance for all individuals. I
                    know that I have a role to play to bring my dream into fruition. I am currently on a journey of selfdiscovery.
                    This is what led me into signing up to join the National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights
                    Commission (Kenya). I am looking forward to taking part in the Upinde Awards, specifically the
                    Chanzo Award, which recognizes and appreciates the human rights work of young and upcoming
                    human rights defenders. I've started writing articles, advocating for diversity and acceptance, and I
                    know this will be fruitful.</p>
                <p>I am dedicated to tirelessly working towards a future where inclusivity in Kenya transforms to a
                    tangible reality, for those alive, and those yet to come.</p><br><br>

                        <p><u><b>LIFE OUTSIDE OF STRUCTURE</b></u></p>
                        <p>The classroom was oddly quiet, despite the background symphony of scribbling pencils, the
                            distant laughter of a neighboring class, and the hushed chatter and giggles emanating from a
                            group on the far side of the room. It was a rare free period for me, and I was completely absorbed
                            in my studies. My desk, a canvas of graffiti left behind by its previous owners, was now home to a
                            treasure trove of reference books. I was in my element, lost in the world of knowledge when I felt a
                            tap on my shoulder.</p>
                        <p>Turning around, I saw my friend from a different academic stream, her eyes shimmering with
                            anticipation. "Hey, I've got a test paper from my teacher. Want to go over it tonight?" Her
                            enthusiasm was infectious, but I had to deliver a disappointing truth—I wasn't free that night or the
                            next three nights, for that matter.</p>
                        <p>My trusty notebook, which technically belonged to my sister but had been "borrowed" by me in
                            2021 before my return to boarding school, sat faithfully on my desk. To me, it was more than just a
                            notebook; it was an extension of my very being. Its covers were pristine white, adorned with two
                            tiny hearts—one pink, the other red—right at the front’s center. The pages within were thick,
                            smooth, and partially resistant to my attempts to flip them due to my refusal to crack the book's
                            spine. In high school, I had transformed it into a planner, where I scrupulously outlined how, when,
                            and where I would spend every moment of my day.</p>
                        <p>That notebook provided me with structure. Every Sunday, I dedicated over an hour to plan my
                            upcoming week down to the minute. And if, by some cruel twist of fate, my plans were disrupted, it
                            felt like the whole world was falling apart. I would find myself facing an existential choice: should I
                            aimlessly wander through the week or scrap my meticulously crafted timetable and start anew?
                            My high school life unfolded within this framework, a rigid schedule that guided me through my
                            extracurricular activities, study sessions, and even chores. It was a system that kept me
                            consistently ahead of the curve, and I cherished it.
                            </p>
                        <p>However, there were sacrifices involved in adhering to such a system. I learned to turn a blind eye
                            to impromptu conversations, no matter how intriguing or amusing they seemed, because I had already assigned that time slot to Chemistry. I turned down discussions with friends, citing prior
                            commitments that left no room for spontaneity. While my notebook offered efficiency, I couldn't
                            help but notice that my unwavering devotion to schedules was gradually fencing in the fun in life.
                            Therefore, I decided to try and venture outside of the restrictiveness brought about by my
                            notebook.</p>
                        <p>Admittedly, I initially feared the discord that this action may give rise to in my life but eventually, I
                            mustered the courage to break free from the shackles of my fastidiously planned existence. It
                            wasn't easy at first, but as I embraced impulsiveness, I discovered a world brimming with
                            opportunities and newfound freedom. Saying "yes" to that discussion might mean seeing a
                            familiar topic from a fresh perspective or savoring novel experiences that breathed life into my
                            high school years.</p>
                        <p>My journey beyond the boundaries of my regimented schedule taught me a profound lesson: life
                            thrives on balance, striking a delicate harmony between order and freedom. It became easier to
                            deviate from the strict confines of my notebook, which I had once considered inviolable. I began
                            using it not only to record schedules but also to doodle, jot down brilliant and silly ideas, and truly
                            embrace the richness of spontaneity.</p>
                        <p>In the end, my notebook remained a trusty companion, but now it held more than just schedules—it
                            cradled my evolution in which I sought equilibrium between the pursuit of knowledge and the joy
                            of living.</p><br><br>
