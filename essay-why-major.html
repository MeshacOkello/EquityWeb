            <h1 class="display-4">Why Major Essays</h1>
            <p class="lead"></p>
            <hr class="my-4">
            <p>Tons of colleges require a supplemental essay that essentially asks, “Why do you want to major in what you want to major in?” <br>
                Two quick tips: <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>It’s worth spending some time on these essays to make sure your answer complements your personal statement. What do I mean? If your personal statement is all about business and your “Why Major” college essay is all about dance, admissions readers might be like, “Whaaaat?” So make sure they make sense together.</li>
                    <li>Just because you pick a major for this essay, it doesn’t mean you 100% can’t change it later. In many cases, you can. (Important: This varies from school to school, so if you’re unsure, find out.) It can help to choose a major as a placeholder, though, as it makes this essay a LOT easier to write.</li> 
                </ol>

            <h1 class="display-4">So, What Does A “Why This College Major” Essay Look Like?</h1>
            <p>Take a look at some "Why Major" prompts from previous years...</p><br>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Yale University:</b> Students at Yale have plenty of time to explore their academic interests before committing to one or more major fields of study. Many students either modify their original academic direction or change their minds entirely. As of this moment, what academic areas seem to fit your interests or goals most comfortably? Please indicate up to three from the list provided. Why do these areas appeal to you? </li><br>
                    <li><b>Princeton University:</b> As a research institution that also prides itself on its liberal arts curriculum, Princeton allows students to explore areas across the humanities and the arts, the natural sciences, and the social sciences. What academic areas most pique your curiosity, and how do the programs offered at Princeton suit your particular interests?</li><br>
                    <li><b>University of Pensylvania:</b> How did you discover your intellectual and academic interests, and how will you explore them at the University of Pennsylvania? Please respond considering the specific undergraduate school you have selected. (300-450 words)</li><br>
                    In short: Why do you want to study what you want to study, and at that specific university?
                </ul>

        <div class="jumbotron">
            <h1 class="display-4">Researching the Why This Major Essay</h1><br>
            <p> Whether or not the student has already picked their intended major, it’s essential to do some preliminary research. It may sound obvious, but you’d be surprised to hear how many students dash off a why this major essay without ever visiting the college website. Most college websites will be neatly laid out, with an “Academics” page linking to the various majors and minors on offer.</p>
            <p>Students may find that a particular college combines several of their interests into one major. A major in Sustainable Development will require courses on environmental science, economics, and architecture. Some colleges even offer an independent study option, allowing students to combine several disciplines of their choice as they work on a specific senior project.</p>
            <p>Once the student has narrowed down their interests to around 1 – 3 majors, they should take notes on any aspects of the programs that appeal to them. These can include the curriculum and courses offered, research taking place in the department, study abroad options, labs, etc. Department websites also provide insight into current and previous students’ thesis work. These notes will make drafting the why this major essay a lot easier, and will provide real evidence that the student is genuinely interested in the program.</p>

            <h1 class="display-4">Samples time!</h1><br>
            <ul>
                <li><p><b>WHY ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING?</b></p>
                    <p>My decision to major in Electrical Engineering was inspired by my desire to improve security through technology. When I lived in Mexico, my father’s restaurant security system lacked the ability to protect our property from robbers, who would break in multiple times a year. Thanks to the influence of my cousin, who now studies Autonomous Systems, I developed an interest in electrical engineering. I am inspired to not only improve my father’s security system, but contributing to security innovations for larger companies and perhaps, one day, national security. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>WHY GENDER AND SEXUALITY STUDIES?</b></p>
                    <p>My interest in Gender and Sexuality Studies was sparked in my eighth grade Civics class when we studied topics pertaining to sexual equality. I went into the class knowing I believed women had a right to make choices for their own bodies and that view remained the same, but I discovered the complexity of abortion debates. I challenged myself by thinking about the disparity between actual and potential personhood and the moral rights of unconscious lives. If pregnancy had the same consequences for men as it does women, how might the debate be different? Would this debate even exist? </p>
                    <p>A year later, I shadowed an OB/GYN at a nearby hospital. On my first shift, I watched an incarcerated woman receive a post-partum exam after giving birth in her cell toilet with just Advil, and the issues discussed in Civics suddenly became urgent and real.</p>
                    <p>My school projects have often focused on reproductive rights. I’ve spent numerous hours delving into summaries of Supreme Court cases on abortion and contraception, and am even known as the “Tampon Fairy” at school because I frequently restock the school bathrooms with tampons and condoms. </p>
                    <p>I’m interested in exploring how Gender and Sexuality Studies connect to Public Health and Reproductive Biology, as well as Public Policy and Law. The interdisciplinary nature of this major will allow me to investigate many other areas of study and create a more nuanced understanding of how this particular field interacts with our world and society.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>WHY NEUROSCIENCE?</b></p>
                    <p>Imagine all the stars in the universe. The brain has a thousand times the number of synapses, making neurological errors a near certainty. I learned this fact firsthand as a 14 year-old, when I suffered from sleepless nights because of an uncomfortable, indescribable feeling in my leg. It took months of appointments and tests to be told it was a condition called cortical dysplasia. Even after the diagnosis, there is no cure.</p>
                    <p>I am lucky. My condition does not severely affect my quality of life. However, I know this is not the case for everyone. After this experience, I took AP Biology and attended a neuroscience program, which reinforced the subject as my future calling. One of the most impactful lectures discussed the plight of healthcare in developing nations. Newborns with extreme neurological deficits are common, but finding treatments is not. Without prenatal care, this is becoming a growing epidemic, leaving millions of children helpless.</p>
                    <p>With a degree in neuroscience, I will gain a strong understanding of neural tube development and neuronal migration in infants. I will then become a neurologist, specializing in pediatric care. I hope to work for humanitarian organizations, such as Doctors Without Borders, in Africa, where HIV and polio are rampant, as are numerous other diseases.</p>
                    <p>Imagine the stars once more. From across the world, I will look at the same stars in the future, as I help children secure the ability to not only look at the stars, but do much more.</p>
